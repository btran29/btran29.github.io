# Bio
I study clinicians’ work to inform the design of automated documentation assistance systems.

I am a MD-PhD student in the [Health and Information lab](http://hai.ics.uci.edu/) at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), focusing on [healthcare informatics](https://www.amia.org/fact-sheets/what-informatics). My research aims to help clinicians foreground patient-centered clinical activities in their work by automating data entry and collection. My work bridges areas including human-computer interaction and computer supported collaborative work.

Previously, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at University of California, Irvine. As an undergraduate research assistant associated with the Pediatric Exercise and Genomics Research Center (PERC), I investigated altered physiology in childhood obesity.
