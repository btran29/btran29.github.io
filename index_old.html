			<h1>Brian D. Tran</h1>
			<p>I study clinicians’ work to inform the design of automated documentation assistants.</p>
			<p> I am a MD/PhD student in Informatics at University of California, Irvine, in the Health and Information lab, focusing on healthcare informatics. My research aims to help clinicians foreground patient-centered clinical activities in their work by automating less meaningful activities associated data entry and collection. My work bridges areas including human-computer interaction and computer supported collaborative work. </p>
			<p> Previously, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at University of California, Irvine. As an undergraduate research assistant associated with the Pediatric Exercise and Genomics Research Center (PERC), I investigated physiological changes in pediatric obesity. </p>
